# github-practice-lidiya
Hi, I'm Lidiya.
This repository is created as part of a GitHub practice assignment to demonstrate my understanding of Git and GitHub. It includes tasks like creating commits, branching, merging, and optionally collaborating with others. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with version control in real-world development workflows.
