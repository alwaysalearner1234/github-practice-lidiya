What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track and manage changes in their code. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, supports branching and merging, and keeps a full history of every change made. Git is widely used in software development and is an essential tool for collaboration, especially when working with platforms like GitHub.
